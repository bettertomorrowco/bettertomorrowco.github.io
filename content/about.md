There was a time when people cared more about how their goods were made, who made them, and where they came from. Quality, longevity and proximity were just as important as price. People expected things to last. Furniture was passed down through generations. Food was bought from local markets. People knew how the goods they bought were made and often knew the person making them. There was a thriving economy of small business owners, selling locally to others.

Today, things are a lot different. We are almost entirely focused on price. Most of the things we purchase are made overseas in countries where people work in terrible conditions, for incredibly low pay, making poor quality products. The raw materials used to make those goods often travel thousands of kilometers from their source to where they are assembled into products, and then those products are shipped thousands more kilometers to their final destination, mostly powered by fossil fuels. Most of the things we buy are made by companies who don't care very much about people, the environment, or the quality of their goods. Small businesses have been pushed out by large wealthy  corporations who are driven soley by profit.

In North America, we consume an incredible amount. Because of low labour costs in Asia, we have access to incredibly cheap goods. You would think that would make us happier, allow us to save more money, work less and live a healthier life, but it hasn't. In North America, we are deeply in debt, spending more than ever, very unhealthy and on average not very happy. And, our over-consumption that isn't leading us to a better life, is directly leading to climate change.

Is there a different way? We think so. We can choose to consume differently. We can buy quality products that are made locally, with renewable and sustainable materials, by companies who care about the planet and their employees. But it's not that easy. It's currently too hard to know where products are made, where their raw materials come from, how they impact the environment and how the people making them are treated. Also, there are many products you simply cannot purchase locally, because all of that production has been moved overseas. That's where we come in.

# Our Mission:

- To promote the creation and sale of quality goods that are made locally, with local sustainable and renewable materials, by companies who care about the planet, their customers and their people.
- To help consumers consume better instead of consuming more, by bringing transparency to the process of purchasing goods.
- To establish standards by which to measure companies accross a range of values that consumers care about.

# Our Values:

- **Fact-based**: We aim to give an opinion that is supported by facts and grounded in reality.
- **Transparent**: We want consumers to trust us, so if we have a bias or conflict, or are being compensated by a company, we will say so.
- **Caring**: We care about our people, our consumers and the planet.



# The Plan:

So, that's all good and well, but how do we intend to accomplish our mission. Plans can change and usually do, but this is what we're thinking:

- Establish a method of evaluating companies that looks holistically at how goods are made including:
  - **Sustainability**: Are the products made in a way that can continue without having a negative impact on the planet, including operations and raw materials.
  - **Safety**: Are the products made with processes and materials that are safe for consumers and workers.
  - **Quality**: Are the products built to last, how are they supported.
